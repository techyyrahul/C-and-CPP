// This is the third program of C language in which we will learn how to print something in different lines and with some spaces(four or eight) somewhat like using the "Tab key".

// Code for Online Compiler

// #include<stdio.h>

// void main()
// {
//     printf("Your_Name\n\t");
//     printf("School/College/Company_Name\n\t\t");
//     printf("City_Name");

// You can copy the code and remove the two '//' for turbo c++

// Here the two forward slash // stands for comments which are not read by machine but just by us who read and write the code
